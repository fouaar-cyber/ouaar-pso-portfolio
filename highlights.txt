Highlights

• Novel utility-feedback PSO with adaptive inertia for portfolio optimization
• Shrinkage estimation and factor-structured higher moments reduce estimation error
• Block-bootstrap inference for robust performance evaluation
• Adaptive PSO improves over fixed-ω in developed markets
• Simple benchmarks dominate in emerging markets due to estimation error
